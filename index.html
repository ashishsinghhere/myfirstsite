<em>DO YOU KNOW that being rich is totally different from being educated, is you have read this book called rich dad poor dad then you probly know that robert poor father
   was very much educated than his rich father but still he was poor, what you think the reason could be yes you got it <STRONG> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_literacy">FINANCIAL LITRECY.</a> </strong><br> 
   but unfortunately in india this ratio is very high people are having so my knowlege and skills bot still lacking  the money in their pockets  <br>
   and this is why we have launched a fianncial litrecy material for the age group of 10 to 18 because we belive financial litercy is more of a lifestyle than a concept
   the material that we are providing is full of knowledge that seves you hoe money works how can you invest,how can you secure your retirement and easy it is to become rich
   all the material is programmed by the indias best financial gurus so that we feed valuable knowledge to the students.<br></em> <hr size="4" color="indigo">
